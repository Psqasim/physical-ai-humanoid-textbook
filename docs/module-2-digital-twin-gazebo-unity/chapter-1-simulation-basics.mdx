# Chapter 1: Simulation Basics

Learn the fundamentals of robot simulation, including setting up environments, spawning robots, and running physics-based tests.

## Topics Covered

- Why simulation matters for robotics development
- Setting up Gazebo Classic and Gazebo Fortress
- Creating URDF models for your robot
- Simulating sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU)

## Hands-On Exercise

By the end of this chapter, you'll simulate a mobile robot in Gazebo and visualize its sensor data in RViz.
