# Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module explores Digital Twin technology for robotics, covering simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity. You'll learn how to create virtual replicas of robots and test them safely before deploying to real hardware.

## What You'll Learn

- Digital Twin concepts and sim-to-real transfer
- Setting up Gazebo for robotics simulation
- Integrating Unity for advanced visualization
- Testing and validating robot behaviors in simulation

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 basics)
- Basic 3D graphics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with physics engines (optional)
