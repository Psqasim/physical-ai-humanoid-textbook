# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This course provides a comprehensive journey through embodied intelligence, teaching you how to build intelligent robots that understand and interact with the physical world.

## Course Overview

You'll explore four interconnected modules:

1. **ROS 2: Robotic Nervous System** - Learn the middleware that powers modern robotics
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Master simulation for safe, iterative development
3. **NVIDIA Isaac (AI-Robot Brain)** - Integrate AI models for perception and decision-making
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Build robots that understand natural language commands

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills (Python or C++)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic AI/ML concepts (helpful but not required)

## How to Use This Textbook

- Follow the modules sequentially for a structured learning path
- Each chapter includes explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises
- Use the integrated AI tutor (coming soon) to ask questions as you learn
- Personalize the content to your skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI!
