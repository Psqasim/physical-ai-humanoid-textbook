# Chapter 1: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Models

<ChapterActionsBar chapterTitle="Introduction to VLA" />

Learn what VLA models are, how they bridge vision, language, and robotics, and why they represent the future of embodied AI.

## Topics Covered

- Evolution from computer vision to VLA models
- Key VLA architectures (RT-1, RT-2, PaLM-E, OpenVLA)
- How VLA models process language and visual inputs
- Generating robot actions from natural language

## Hands-On Exercise

By the end of this chapter, you'll run a pre-trained VLA model to control a simulated robot using natural language commands like "pick up the red block."
