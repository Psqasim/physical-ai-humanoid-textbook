## What You'll Learn

- ROS 2 architecture and design philosophy
- Creating nodes and managing communication
- Using tools like rqt and rviz for debugging
- Integrating ROS 2 with simulators and real hardware

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills (Python or C++)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)
